```bash

NOTION_EVENTS_ID=

```

### Database

We use Prisma to manage our database. Once you have configure `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`, you may push the schema by running:

```bash
prisma migrate deploy
```

Our database provider for account management is [Supabase](https://supabase.io), but any Prisma-compatible database will work.

The actual Notion database is managed by the Notion API, and is not managed by Prisma, it is used to query all spaces, events and organizations.

### Running the App

To run the app, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

If you wish to run in SSL mode, run:

```bash
yarn devssl
```

You should have a local certificate in the root directory generated with `mkcert` called `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem`. If developing with Firefox, you must also install `nss`.

```bash
brew install nss
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
```

### Deploying

We use Vercel to deploy our app. Clone the repo:
